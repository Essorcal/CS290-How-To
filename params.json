{"name":"Google Maps API How to Guide","tagline":"","body":"### Introduction\r\n\r\nGoogle offers many different API's for their different search, web and data analytic services.  For this how to guide we will be focusing on the Google maps API and adding map functionality to your website. To begin, Google's documentation can be found at the following link: [Google documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/).  One of the nice things about Google's Maps v3 API is there is no need for an API key if you stay under 1,000 requests per day. That being said creating an API key is free and allows you to monitor and track the API usage. Once you go over a certain number of requests per day then you will be charged based on API usage.  The pricing structure can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/pricing-and-plans/).\r\n\r\n### Getting an API key\r\n\r\nEven though for the amount of requests used to create this how to guide an API key was not required the steps to get one are laid out below for completeness and in case necessary. On the main Google documentation page [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/)\r\nChoose the following **Get a Key** option at the top\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\\images\\GetaKey.png\">\r\n\r\nOn the next screen **Activate the Google Maps Javascript API** choose **Continue**.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\\images\\ActivateKey.jpg\">\r\n\r\nNext create a new project and choose **continue**.\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/Essorcal/CS290-How-To/blob/gh-pages/images/ActivateKey.jpg)\r\nOn the credentials page choose create credentials and create a new API key.\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/Essorcal/CS290-How-To/blob/gh-pages/images/APIKey.png)\r\n\r\nNext choose **browser key**\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\\images\\BrowserKey.png\">\r\n\r\nFinally name the browser key and input any HTTP referrers to limit API requests to only your sites so no one can use your API requests.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\\images\\CreateKey.png\">\r\n\r\n### Adding a Map\r\n\r\nIn order to add a map to a web page i've added the following sample code which is a barebones example of initializing an HTML site and adding a map.  The map is centered on my hometown of Augusta Georgia!\r\n\r\n`<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html>\r\n   <head>\r\n      <script src = \"http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js\"></script>\r\n      \r\n      <script>\r\n         function loadMap() {\r\n\t\t\t\r\n            var mapOptions = {\r\n               center:new google.maps.LatLng(33.474246, -82.00967), \r\n               zoom:10, \r\n               mapTypeId:google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP\r\n            };\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n            var map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById(\"test\"),mapOptions);\r\n         }\r\n\t\t\t\r\n         google.maps.event.addDomListener(window, 'load', loadMap);\r\n      </script>\r\n      \r\n   </head>\r\n   \r\n   <body>\r\n      <div id = \"test\" style = \"width:600px; height:600px;\"></div>\r\n   </body>\r\n   \r\n</html>`\r\n\r\nNow here is the result!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"\\images\\Map.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Walking through the example\r\n\r\nGoogle has very extensive documentation for all of their API's which can be overwhelming so this guide will be about starting at the absolute basics and going over available options and getting a map started and working from there.\r\n\r\nSo the very first part of the non HTML code is setting the source for where the data the API we're accessing is.\r\n\r\nThe first example below is the basic javascript API call without an individual API key\r\n'<script src = \"http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js\"></script>'\r\nThe next example is what needs to be added to that call to associate the API key the guide went over getting in the first section \r\n'<script src=\"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&callback=initMap'\r\n\r\nYOUR_API_KEY is replaced with the series of letters and numbers generated when you create the API key.\r\n\r\nSo a completed example could look like the following (fake API key used for the example)\r\n'<script src=\"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=HSD2349f12hfn28cn2109x8h3nc8je2o1icj9045&callback=initMap'\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
